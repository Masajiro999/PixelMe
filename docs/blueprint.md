- Accent color: Light Pink (#F7CAD0), slightly offset from lavender on the color wheel, adding contrast as a highlight color for interactive elements.
- Font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif font that provides a modern, fashionable feel, suitable for headings and UI text. 
- Use simple, clean icons, reminiscent of 16-bit games, for actions like 'download' and 'share.'
